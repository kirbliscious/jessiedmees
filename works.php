I love the reaction viewers have once they take a closer glance and realize the pieces are actual cast cockroaches. They often become grossed out after having been drawn in by the form and wild coloring. Splat is a headpiece that was created using several different processes. The cockroaches where found and cast in sterling silver, the splatter is a variety of different bronzes collected from a casting machine after they had been abandoned, which were then fused together, and the cap is a domed sheet of brass that has been etched.
